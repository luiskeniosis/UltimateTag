# UltimateTag
Recreation of one of Dream's plugins. For the price of free.

This plugin will scan the map in 50x50 sections to find "arenas". A 50x50 arena is valid if it does not contain an ocean biome.

Players will alternate between being "it", and will have a time limit to tag the other player. Currently only supports 1v1.
